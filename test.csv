6,True,Hello all ... Well I board the chemo train tomorrow morning ... and get off on May 28th -LRB- last treatment -RRB- not that I am counting or anything . Mina_Bird I agree with Marion ... you have to do everything you can while you can . My Onco score made it very easy for me as it was high middle range . I had a very very small tumor -LRB- 6mm -RRB- but grade 3 . They did not think I would need chemo but score showed something different . So with Chemo and hormones my risk becomes significantly lower . Onco says chemo will really help to ensure that I stay in the good cancer boat as he called it . Only you can decided what to do . Marion how long did it take for your hair to grow back ? Any advice on the whole chemo thing ... I was really hoping to miss it but I have to this so ... off I go !,stay in the good cancer boat as he called it .
5,False,"This has been the perfect thread for me and it 's just at the right time , too . You all have made me laugh and admire each of you . The pics are just wonderful and you all look sooo young . I am 3Î¾1/2 month post dmx and still have lots of lumpy , bumpy swirly things under my arms and down my sides . The fat is completely gone from my chest wall and my ribs stick out with a few small lumps that probably will go away given time and enough massage . The docs keep ordering forms and my insurance will pay for them but I have a hard time even wanting to get them . Partly this is being lazy - way too much work and partly I think wearing any kind of a bra would still be way uncomfortable . There is a political statement here and it 's important . If one on eight of us get this miserable disease and some percentage end up with double mastectomies , how can any of us feel like we have a real choice in our breast oriented culture to go flat without feeling intimidated if we never see anyone who is ? I am so proud of us !! Hardly anyone really notices and when they do the response is either to look away or stare . So what ? The boobless are here and are visible !! I 've been wearing tee shirts and jeans with really short hair , -LRB- about the length men used to wear it before they started letting it grow out -RRB- so I look like a prepubescent boy with dangly earrings . I am just 5 feet at 120 lbs and recently have more fat migration to my belly plus that old fat shelf that was always there but I could n't see over my 38D matronly shelf . I attribute that to the aromasin and absolutely no estrogen floating around to add feminine curves . I do not look curvy and sexy no matter what I wear .

5,True,"So when SS tells breast cancer patients , or any cancer for that matter , that `` chemo will kill you '' , is that not `` black or white '' .

6,True,"Fiona condolences on the loss of your son . Basically the less than positive issues are the # of affected nodes , the 2 fairly large tumors , ER , PR negative and HER + . Your oncologist can give # 's but dont let them throw you , you are the only number you care about . The docs will likely so studies to look for spread outside the breast - possibly a bone scan + / - a CT chest abdomen and pelvis to see if the cells settled anywhere else . The HER + means its fairly aggressive but it gives you Herceptin as an option . ER/PR - means you probably wont be given tamoxifen which is used in estrogen/progesterone sensitive tumors . They may even suggest radiation after chemo . Find an oncologist you trust , get a 2nd opinion and go forward . Let people help you and dont let anyone tell you how to feel . Check the boards when you know what your chemo will be - everyone is different but it helps to talk to others in same boat , you can all help row .

0,True,"As I understand it , the breast will drain into one primary sentinel node . Sometimes it becomes 2 nodes if they are nearby each other and the drainage is shared . Once a mx is done , there is no way to check which is the `` gatekeeper '' node any longer , so if there is a suspicion of CA , they 'll want to check the nodes along with the mx . However , if a mx is prophylactic , then no cancer is assumed . The risk for lymphedema is not a solid number at this time , as there are many variables , the primary one being how many lymph nodes were taken out . That said , there are those who have developed LE with no sentinel node disturbance - the mx surgery itself was enough . Things that can also set it off later down the road are : blood pressure taken , needle sticks , infected bug bites , pressure changes experienced while flying in a plane - anything which can compromise pressure or stimulate an inflammatory response . Some people are triggered more easily than others . Some swell more than others . It 's good to know about , since those unclear percentages of how many of us get it are somewhere between 5-30 % , depending upon which reports you read . A great site is : http://www.stepup-speakout.org which was created by some of our own breast cancer survivors who developed LE . They are medically trained , one being a doctor herself . I developed LE after Stage 1 . By Stage 2 I had been diagnosed and had read up on it .

0,True,"Hi Kerry ... good to plan ahead . I too had a bilateral mastectomy - September 2007 . Like the other ladies have said , things that do up in the front are great - zippered hoodies , button shirts and loose pants with elastic waist -LRB- easy to pull up -RRB- are great . Have n't heard about the bra from the hospital - I did n't have that . The bandages were actually pretty easy to address . My surgeon told me that as long as there was no seepage , I could leave them off after 36 hours to allow the air to help with the healing . I was only in the hospital some 24 hours and then home . I was allowed to shower 48 hours post surgery as long as I did not directly soak the wounds . I did have a drain . I tied 2 shoe laces together and pinned the drain onto them around my neck . The drain has a pin -LRB- like a safety pin -RRB- which clipped to my underwear and/or top - depending on your comfort . My other suggestion - keep some glasses / dishes on top of the counter . Reaching into cupboards will not be easy - good exercise but not easy at first . Make sure you have some cream that your surgeon approves ... sometimes the tape can irritate your skin . As someone else said too ... the anaesthetic and pain meds can cause constipation . Make sure you are eating fibre and/or taking some stool softeners so that there is no `` additional '' pain with passing stool . Do try to eat as well as you can ... keeping your body strong will help healing and will also help your body prepare for the road ahead - be it chemo or radiation or something different . Go slow , take care and do the exercises ... getting your mobility back is important and will also help your mental wellbeing . Think positive ... I was pleasantly surprised at how little true pain there was in the bilateral mastectomy . PS - do n't worry about the prosthetics just yet ... I was about 3 months before I thought about it . Having had a large chest pre-surgery , I 'm enjoying the freedom of the surgery - ha !!! Laura in Victoria , BC Canada ",your body prepare for the road ahead - be it chemo

4,True,"Hi Apple - I totally agree with everyone here , but I see that you are already in agreement too . Thank God for that ! The only other suggestion I have is to try to EDUCATE your husband about breast cancer . When he says you 're spending too much time online - tell him you are RESEARCHING your disease . Use the word `` disease '' - I 'm finding some men act like BC is nothing more serious than a bad case of acne . They have heard so many `` success '' stories - that they think `` no big deal '' . Has your husband gone with you to your doctor appointments ? Your doctor could sit down and explain to him your risks of recurrence should you choose to do nothing . Some doctors are afraid to spell out in dirty detail what actually happens at the end of BC ... ... so print out the scary scene flyrzfan posted above and show him . Also - if your doctor or nurse can give you written details about what your treatment will be - how long - the side effects - it should help you make realistic plans . I am one who really believes in planning ahead - especially on this roller-coaster ride - better to sit in the front seat with your eyes wide open to see what 's coming than cower in the back !

0,True,"Dear dee1402 , JMHO I hope you do n't mind my intervention in your diagnosis but I recommend getting as much testing and biopsy done before having just a lumpectomy of one area . From my past experience of being a Breast Imaging Specialist and a Breast Cancer Survivor doctors tend to assume that they will get all ca tissue out with lumpectomy and do lots of time . Get an MRI of your breast that is a dedicated Breast Unit ASAP and definitely before surgery . Even MRI imaging does not show everything -LRB- not the best for any in-situ findings -RRB- but does tend to show enlarged nodes , invasive ca , and potential problems . If you are told that you have very dense breast that can be difficult to diagnose that is a risk of having more going on than they can prove by imaging . We see this all the time at our Breast Center and try very hard to interpret to the very best ability but things still get missed . I do n't want to scare you but do want to help you make good decisions . My ca was missed for sev yrs but I have a very untypical type of invasive lobular ca that I finally found myself 2 mths after Cat 2 Benign findings mammo read by extremely good radiologist . My ca had to have been there for sev yrs because of size and 5 + lymph nodes . So beware of trusting imaging totally . Surgeons tend to trust imaging 150 % and are mostly ultra conservative these days on taking breast tissue . It is wonderful to be able to have a lumpectomy and save the breast but not if you leave cells behind . Br Ca is very sneaky and can simmer for years with no symptoms . Sometimes by the time it will show up on imaging or produce symptoms it is already Stage 3 and you are battling for your life . It is still treatable at this stage but my onc has told me I will never be considered cured even if I live to be 100 . If caught early it can be cured . So just be diligent and get proactive and arm yourself with as much knowledge as possible . If you can find a Dr. who actually is a BR CA Surgeon not just a general surgeon he will be much more cautious and try to really find out what is in your breast . I also recommend seeing a good Breast Onc after MRI and get all results you can to take to him and ask him to review your actual mammo and MRI , Breast U/S , and any other studies one on one with good Breast Radiologist . If you can get these guys looking at a more personal level and talking it is always an advantage . You can get 2nd opinions which I would do before any surgery is done . Sorry for such a long post but I do not want others to have regrets that they did not pursue every avenue to finding ca early and being able to have a cure . Hope this does not offend you and I would be glad to talk with you privately if you would like . You may send me a private message if you have other questions or if would rather I keep my opinions to myself . I will understand because I know all of this is scary and you feel frustrated . Hope everything works out for you and this is just a bump in the road . Whatever you do must be your decision not anyone elses . You must be comfortable with that > Saying a prayer for you now if you do n't mind . God bless you and keep you , LOL , gin2ca ",just a bump in the road . Whatever you do must

An way in December I finally had an MRI that showed metastatic disease - a biopsy confirmed it as metastatic disease from the orignial breast cancer -LRB- it was estrogen positive -RRB- . A bone scan showed involvement in the right trocantar as well . am currently on Femara and Zometa . I had to have a rod in my femur and pins to my trochanter -LRB- hip -RRB- .

0,True,I also opted for a bi-lateral mastectomy after diagnosis of bc in one breast . After my surgery my good breast also showed ALH and probably would have cooked up the same thing down the road . I chose to remove them both because it was so darn hard to find the breast cancer the first time . I had very dense breasts and did not trust imaging . It is funny because I still do not know if the thickened area was the breast cancer or if the breast cancer was hiding under the fibrocystic dense breast tissue . I had the thickened area for two years and had mammos and ultrasounds which showed nothing as well as breast surgeons who said it was fibrocystic dense breast tissue . My thickened area was also in the upper outer quadrant and was a much larger area than the size of my tumor . My tumor was deep -LRB- just 2 mm from the chest wall -RRB- so who knows what the thickened area was . All I can say is know your breasts well and check out anything that seems unusual .

0,True,"Hi ladies ! I have had a big week . My BMX w/immediate DIEP was on Tuesday -LRB- 5/18 -RRB- and I came home this afternoon - 5/23 . The surgery was really long - @ 12 hours . I was really out of it in post-op and I do n't think I even opened one eye in there - I would slowly answer a question or two . My husband was waiting for me up in my room -LRB- no roommate ! -RRB- and he offered to spend the night and I said just go home , because I was really uncomfortable and so sleepy . I really do n't remember much of that day ! Days 2 and 3 were similar - very painful and I just slept and slept and slept . The nurses had me get out of bed for the 1st time on day # 2 . That just about killed me . I threw up two times after walking . I was wiped out and really felt nauseous . I remembered other people on here writing about getting out of bed for the first time , and I knew it would be important to get moving . So , I just pushed ahead and did it . My nurse called my PS to see if he would prescibe a little patch for nausea - it is placed just a little under the ear . It is effective for 72 hours . It worked great ! I did more walking with each day . The catheter was removed on day # 3 - I could make it into the bathroom by then . The pain was terrible for me , I will not gloss it over . My doctors and nurses tried all sorts of pain killers . Started with morphine , percocet , and other such drugs . I am now on Oxycodon and that is the one that works for me . I do get really tired , but that 's OK . By late yesterday -LRB- day # 4 -RRB- , I was feeling much better and hoping to go home the following day . I left the hospital @ 2:00 p.m. today on day # 5 . I am so happy to be home . There is no rest in the hospital . I needed to be woken every hour to have doppler on my new breasts to check blood flow , and this was increased to every 2 hours on day # 3 and then down to every 4 hours at the end . Plus , there were the checks from the nurses ' aides for vital statistics , the nurses that would administer medications and check in on me and the people who cleaned the room . What a difference it makes to be at home ! My DIEP procedure went very well - I finally was brave enough to look and love what I see . My husband thinks they look and feel great ! They are warm and soft - my own tissue , just from a different location . I increased the size and went from a `` B '' cup to a `` C '' cup . My PS did a fantastic job . My arm movement has not been painful at all and things are going pretty well for me . Thank you , Lord . My BS called me a few days after surgery with the results . I was having the BMX mainly for DCIS -LRB- one place -RRB- on the right breast . She found another spot of DCIS in the right breast and my left breast had something as well - ADH . She said it was good that I had listened to my heart - I truly believe I was guided in this decision from a higher authority ! I have read other stories similar to mine . I am grateful that all turned out well - nothing invasive ! I have a long road ahead of me and I plan to be very lazy ! I do not want to do too much - my goal is complete healing . This is a very long and painful surgery - but my breasts look so wonderful - I am so happy . I am praying for all that have had surgery this month , and for those who have dates coming up . As so many others have said - the waiting is so difficult . But , suddenly , it 's all over and your day is here ! You will get through this . The drains -LRB- I have 3 - 1 in each breast and 1 in my abdomen -RRB- are just as bad as most of you have said on this board . I HATE them - they feel as if they are going to rip free and tear open my skin where they are stitched . Stripping and emptying them are n't that bad - but they are a major nuisance . I feel lucky that I only have 3 of them . Sorry to ramble , but I 'm trying to make the most of my awake times . My friends have been bringing dinner all week for my family and this will continue for the next 3 weeks - awesome ! Be well , ladies , and look forward to your new life - body and soul . ",!

Even though we have no other family history of breast cancer in my family I wanted to be proactive as it is rare for men to have breast cancer . Had my baseline mammo when I was 37 and was normal and was told not to come back till I turned 40 . I turned 40 early this year and went for my second mammo in March 2010 . I received a call back for additional pictures of the Rt breast . Second set of films showed microcalcifications -LRB- 80 % chance of being nothing -RRB- and a subsequent BX showed -LRB- I was in the crappy 20 % -RRB- 8 cm of DCIS in the Rt breast . Scary but 100 % treatable and not life threatening . Had a lumpectomy in April 2010 , and my world took a turn for the worst . Pathology showed 0.4 mm of invasive grade 2 , ER/PR + , HER - cancer with angiolymphatic invasion was reported present on path . Had genetic testing and was BRCA 1 normal BRCA 2 was `` suspected deleterious '' , which meant although not 100 % positive it should be treated as positive . In light of this I opted for a double mastecomy in early June just to be on the safe side and the pathology from this surgery showed to have no additional new invasive cancer since the April lumpectomy and the nodes were clean and negative . Had OncoDX test done and result was 21 , which put me in the low end of the intermediate group -LRB- gray zone -RRB- . Radiation was ruled out since double MX took care of the margins . Primary Oncologist is recommeding 4 cycles of T/C due to the angiolymphatic invasion found on the path report in April . She said if that had not been present she would not recommend chemo as the tumor was so small . However , got 2nd opinon from a Oncologist at Stanford , and they said they could recommend chemo but would not push -LRB- as my primary onoclogist seems to be doing -RRB- and they seem to be making this determination based upon tumor size even though angiolymphatic invasion was noted . Stanford also suggested Tamoxifan & Zoladex might be a good way for me to go instead of chemo , but my primary oncologist never suggested this . But of course Stanford said there is no right or wrong choice and it is ultimately my decision . That is what I am having a problem with . I dont have any children and was hoping to try this year -LRB- hence the check-up at my b-day -RRB- when all this was discovered .

If I already had kids the decision of chemo would already have been made . However , the reality is I dont and would still like to . So now what do I do . Tamoxifan is a given as both Oncology Drs seem to agree that the majority of reduction of reoccurance -LRB- 7 % -RRB- will be from the hormone therapy . Meanwhile chemo would only offer and additional 3 % . I would be interested in knowing if any women are in a similar situation as mine . I really and truely do not know how to decide . It seems if I do what my primary onocolgist wants I will have to give up my dream of a child that is biologically mine , but if I dont do chemo and distant reoccurance occurs down the line how do I reconcile that I didnt do all that I could when I had the chance .

5,True,"Good evening Girls , Well I went to Springfield this afternoon . What a mess . There are places that are totally destroyed . Some parts are still without power . A lady at the mall said she is still without heat and it is down to 28 at night and low 40 's in the day . Burrrrr . Some of the stores are still closed and I wanted to go to Best Buy to check on a G.P.S. but they wont be open for 2 more wks . I think you could get a good price on a dinged car . They said on the news some of the repair shops are destroyed and there are sooo many cars needing repaired . Some of the car dealers got tore up . Gee it is amazing what wind can do . We were camping one time with 2 of our kids and got hit by a tornado and it rocked us in our camper . It was pretty scary and I never want to be in one again . I woke at 2 a.m. because it was so quiet . I could n't hear the frogs or crickets and then I heard a train getting louder and louder and then it threw us around . When we got out the giant trees looked like x-mas trees from all the clutter in the tops of them . We sold the camper . The back pain is really getting bad . I think I am going to have to take the pain pills a little more often . Tylenol is n't working anymore . My fingers are bad too . My scalp gets tender on top like when my hair fell out on A/C . It goes away in a couple days . Gosh Nancy Lee you are like the energizer Bunny girlfriend , you make me tired just reading your post . I would make up a new game for the kids called clean the daycare . Gosh , If hubby is going to be back and forth to Texas I can meet up with Janie and P.J. then when we go to Wi . I can check in with Rene . You girls have a truck stop close by ? Oh my lord , I am a trucker mama already . Maybe I will even get to Nancy Lees neck of the woods when it warms up .

0,True,"I was diagnosed with a recurrence on November 22 and given a chemical ooph -LRB- zoladex -RRB- and AIs . As a result , the tumour under my arm is shrinking . This would suggest to me that an ooph can do the same work as chemo . -LRB- It shrunk considerably even before I started the AIs -RRB- In my case , they decided on the hormonal approach as chemo was clearly not a long-term solution . -LRB- I had been given FEC , and then when that did n't work , taxotere , which did work -RRB- However , my cancer is 90 % ER + , while yours is only 16 . Have you asked your onc about the effectiveness of a hormonal treatment ie . ooph in your case ? I think it would be relevant . On the other hand , I note that you are much more PR + . I 'm PR negative and have read that more PR negative women do n't respond to tamoxifen , as in my situation . I do n't know if this means that the corollary is true ie . that tamoxifen is a good medicine for PR + women . All this being said , I wish I did not have to be put into menopause -LRB- I 'm 42 -RRB- and that I could continue to take tamoxifen and be pre-menopausal as before . I did not have any side effects from the tamox , after the hot flashes stopped 4 months into it , and found it very tolerable . One of the things that I find most distressing is that an early ooph can apparently increase your chance of dementia down the road . A few more points - is `` mod-diff '' a reference to the grade of the tumour ? Also , chemo will not necessarily shut down your ovaries . Mine came back after 13 months and I know this is not unusual . Btw , the hot flashes from ooph and AIs have not been too bad so far . Sorry if this is convoluted and hope it 's of some use to you .

During that time I really thought for a time I would never have successful reconstruction and did not grieve what I lost but what I thought would never be reconstructed . I did receive the gift of great looking reconstructed breasts from NOLA even though I was told by the head of the plastic surgery department at home I did not deserve it because our insurance did not have this procedure in network .

I must admit that I think I made the original surgeon feel bad and he is a nice guy I think but could not , would not jepordize his career going to bat with his boss for me -LRB- I guess that 's . understandable -RRB- Since I 'm going on barn animals , he in my opinion was the ultimate chicken .

However , he never recommends an MRI until at least one year after the end of rads . Apparently , there is still a lot of radiation damage inside that lights up on the MRI . Which is exactly what happened to me , cause my chemo onc had me do an MRI about six weeks after rads was over ! SammieKay -- I 'm so sorry to hear about your painful expanders . How much more do they need to add ? When is your exchange surgery ? I must admit , I have to laugh hearing about 600 cc of saline . My boobs are so small , that if I were to do bilat and reconstruction , I think that 60 cc would just about do it - LOL ! Marsha , Marsha , Marsha -- How are you doing ???? We miss you ...

0,True,"Xray girl - I have not been active on the forum for a while so I am catching up and in need of support myself . I will tell you to take your time , I had a deflated TE for months and my PS threw a fit when he found out how long thinking he would need to re do expand . I said no way . This is my first saggy boob ever now I 'm fifty and just make it match the one that had the rads -LRB- which was way up on my chest due to rads -RRB- . Anyway to his surprise the deflatedTE side did not shrink up . I waited for many different reasons for the exchange . One was I got a new job and worked like crazy and got out of the BC world for a while and wore business/dress atire and had some fun . No one knew until I told them . I made a list of pro cons for both and looked at the items , read and chatted here with women and spoke with 6 women in local in my area that had different surgeries . My main concerne was the foob made from my stomach would grow and shrink different than the natural side . At the time I was 48 and was a 34/36 D . But when my weight would go down I would be a C or B . If the new foob acted like stomach fat what would I look like ! -LRB- Before I decided on Double Mast -RRB- At the time with my type of cancer which was not text book so 2 tumor boards at major Houston hospitals gave opinions on treatments . I decided that I wanted the shortest fastest recovery route - which was implants . My doctor wanted to wait 6 months after my rads -LRB- I did not have chemo -RRB- to do exchange but that put us in a rush to extend the tissue -LRB- about a month before rads and not a happy memory -RRB- I ended up having 2 more surgeries expander out then back in due to infection but doc did new procedure on me and wrote a medical paper so I hope it helps others with TE infections . I was worn out after all of that and with a new job and my procrastination I waited 2 years to do the exchange . Which my doctor is now ok with , he said the more time to heal the better the chances . My % were similar to yours I remember something like 40-60 % failure rate and after all my other surgeries I just put it off . I am glad now and so is my PS doctor he has not given me the % but he thinks the implant will stay , he did have to clean up lots of the scar tissue . My cancer type comes back the first 2 years your out look is not so good , so I thought why would I spend that time getting foobs and operations when I could be living a pretty nice life with my family and do the surgery after the 2 years when the outlook is much better for a longer time before recurrence . Read , listen and follow your heart & gut feeling . The few times I did not follow my gut feeling , later I regretted it . Doctors are great and educated but they are not always smarter about what you need . I wish I could help many others with what I have learned but every one has such a different road ahead you have to figure some of this out for your self . My breast onc told me I prob . saved my own life by refusing standard textbook treatement from another oncolg . with my cancer . I knew something was not right and I had read more about my type of cancer than the onc . that was treating me . That does make me feel a little better . This forum is full of support from wonderful women that just want to help you feel the love and have the life you deserve . Love & Hugs to you while you think over all of your decisions .

4,True,"Hi , I 'm a 5 year survivor but not in a great space these days . I made a decision to have a bilat mast due to family history , 1 lymph node involved so due to history I had very aggressive , dose dense chemo . That ended in June of 05 - got it out of the way and went every other week , cut the time in half . Later , I had implants put in -LRB- replaced expanders -RRB- . They did not agree with me . I 'm one of those unlucky ones that contracted auto immune disorder and I kept getting infections in the left breast , last one was bad so the PS finally decided to remove both of my implants . That was Feb. of this year , I have not been the same since . My partner of 15 years thinks its time to move on , however its not so easy . I 'm wondering if I made the right decision , which I DID make becuase I am with a woman so thought it would be easier , was in a long term relationship and just felt o.k. , that was then this is now . NOW , regarless of my sexual preference , my womanhood if you will is just ruined . Intamacy ? Not ! To add insult to injury , when I just wrapped up chemo and before my implants , my partner had an affair with a friend of ours . Even though that was in 2006 I 'm still impacted by that as well . I am not the same person I used to be and do n't know if I can ever find myself again . I 'm very angry , very sad , very upset and just a whole host of `` stuff '' stirring up inside .

I do celebrate , but then the emotional thing of all these months accepting cancer and the possible chance of losing my life from it and now this complete turn around is hard to grasp .

0,True,"Hi I had a right masectomy . I am 58 , divorced , very happily single , not looking at all.When I told the surgeon that I wanted a bilateral , she discouraged me , and urged me to see a plastic surgeon about reconstruction . She mentioned something about a big scar across my chest . So I proceeded to the plastic surgeon.From the minute he touched me and explained the possibilities-I knew immediately that I wanted none of it . I wanted to run out of his office . He was immensely insensitive , also . He said , step into my lab , and took a picture of me naked . Then he literally grabbed and pinched my stomach , and said I had enough fat for a diep , or something . I had to remind him that it was me he was pinching . The whole experience is one I definately want to forget.But it was n't just his manner that made me decide against reconstruction . I am sure there are good plastic surgeons around . I just did n't want the extra pain , or possible se 's . I did n't relish the idea of being asymetrical.But now it does n't bother me at all .

At my last appt in Jan I asked my oncologist about switching and he said he had no problem with me going on Femara ; however , with his patients the side effects have been worse with Femara than Arimidex and he normally starts off his postmenopausal patients on Arimidex . I have read all the studies on both drugs and I ca n't help but believe that Femara may be the better drug for node positive patients . They have just started a clinical trial called FACE where they compare Arimidex and Femara in node positive early stage breast bc . The results wo n't be out for a number of years -LRB- which wo n't help my decision now -RRB- but Novartis is sponsoring the study -LRB- although an independent company will be doing the trial and gathering the results -RRB- and I ca n't help but believe Novartis believes Femara will be the better drug for postmenopausal node positive early stage hormone receptor positive bc . I am having side effects with Arimidex which include joint/muscle pain , bone loss , mild depression or a better word may be apathy and sleep loss but it is tolerable . I am afraid the side effects will be worse with Femara plus they do not yet know for sure if it is OK to switch between the AI 's although many women are doing just that . My sister took Arimidex for over a year and just could not tolerate the pain and switched to Femara . So far the side effects have been better for her . I was on Tamoxifen for 3 months then had an ooph and then started Arimidex . I have been on Arimidex for a year . Should I stick with it or go with my gut and make the switch to Femara .

If there is anyone out there who could shed some light to help me make my decision I would really appreciate it . Sometimes I think I am so anal .

2,True,"Mastectomy removes close to but not 100 % of breast tissue , so there is a very , very small chance of recurrence after mastectomy . Since you 've had a flap reconstruction there is a very good chance that the lump is fat necrosis . This happens when part of the transplanted fat dies and then hardens . This is more common shortly after reconstruction but can occur later . I 'm not sure how well MRI or CT or Ultrasound can tell fat necrosis from cancer . Everything that can not be positively identified on a scan is called a mass , so try not to let the terminolgy freak you out more than necessary . The location of the mass near a lymph node does add to the concern , but the odds are still very , very low that this lump is a rucrrence of bc . I would recommend that you also contact your plastic surgeon about the lump -- he or she will have info on file aobut your surgery that can shed light on what it happening now .

0,True,"It is a very personal decision . NYCarol makes a good point . Part of the reason I decided against chemo was that the doctor reminded me of a couple of things . One , that chemo does n't cut your risk completely , it lowers it by a certain percent and two , that you should weigh the percent of lowering risks against the chance that you will have a serious side effect . For my situation , the oncologist felt that the difference between the benefits of chemo -LRB- about 3 % -RRB- and the chance of getting a secondary cancer or heart disease -LRB- 2 % -RRB- was about 1 - 2 % and was n't worth the chemo so he recommended against it .

Had steriotactic biopsy which showed atypical ductal hyperplasia -LRB- ADH -RRB- , then had surgical biopsy which showed atypical lobular hyperplasia -LRB- ALH -RRB- . Fast forward to Sep 2005 . Had diagnostic mammo and ultrasound requested by breast surgeon due to ADH/ALH . Mammo was clear but ultrasound showed suspicious mass . Ultrasound guided biopsy showed invasive ductal -LRB- IDC -RRB- , grade 2 . IDC was thought to be multi-focal at 1.4 cm and 3 mm . Opted for bi-lateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction due to dense breasts and mammo missing cancer . Bi-lateral mastectomy in Oct 2005 , left breast : 2.1 cm insitu and infiltrating mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features -LRB- IDLC -RRB- , grade 1 with one pos node out of 8 . Strongly ER/PR pos and her2 neg . Right breast : ALH so noncancer breast would have probably cooked up the same thing down the road . Had dose dense chemo AC/T and radiation to chest wall , auxilla and supraclavicle nodes . Was 49 and premenopausal at diagnosis . Chemo put me in chemopause . Started Tamoxifen in Apr 06 before rads and after rads had an oophorectomy and started Arimidex . Have been on Arimidex for a year . My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer a year and a half before me , also stage II with one positive node and the same size tumor , which we both think is weird .

Monday I called my BS he is out on medical leave for a month did n't want to wait any more ! Got an appointment W/my Gyno nurse practitioner . I saw her today . It 's not in my head , she is feeling what I am ! Plus thickening in the area of lump . She checked right breast for symmetry & said left side is definately lumpier than right . Also before I went did another self check & found another ity bity lump in left breast at 12 o'clock on chest wall up high , this one hurts . She also felt that one too . She went over the Biopsy report from BS w/me , what he said was that the spot of micro cals that he could not biop was at or near the chest wall appearing to be under the arm pit ... .

And those SE 's for the CMF chemotini sound dreadful ... of course , not everyone experiences these SE 's ... and they have to be disclosed ... but that 's scary shit ... oops , sorry ... it just slipped out ... must be an SE of BC . Vettegal-I hear you on being impatient ... and agree with all the advice/support already given . I had nodes removed on the left side at the same time as my bilat , and healing is slow , but it does get better little by little and day by day .

My DH was in landscaping for over 15 years before he blew his back out . After three surgeries ending in fusion , he had to give it up .

That 's great !!!! My father is working with a group to restore an old WWII tugboat from Pearl Harbor . He was in Hawaii when it was bombed-he was 5 - and his father was a civil engineer hired by the govt to do things like work on the Panama Canal and stuff . Anyway , my dad feels his father may have been on this tug as he toured the damage and worked on a plan to clear away all the wreckage and repair docks and the like . My mother , who passed away at 58 of Pancreatic Cancer , was a wonderfully funny lady . She often stated that when she retired she wanted to be a poet truckdriver . Hee Hee .

Julie , I am 99 % positive that I 'll be getting a hysterectomy and have my ovaries removed , which is apparently not included in a hysterectomy -LRB- uterus only , I believe -RRB- in order to reduce my likelihood of ovarian cancer . My dad had breast cancer and prostate cancer -LRB- still living -RRB- , and my mother pancreatic cancer -LRB- passed at 58 -RRB- , and all of those cancers are tied to the BRCA2 gene ... so Dad 's taken the BRCA test as of last week-my insurance wo n't cover it because we do n't have enough cancer in the family line ... go figure - If he 's positive , then insurance has to cover my test ... but more importantly , my twin will have no problems getting her test approved . I already did a bilateral mastectomy-which is one choice my oncologist would have strongly suggested had the test results been in hand prior to surgery ... and I 'm glad I did have a bilat ... the right breast did have precancerous cells roaming around . Now , the test will determine if I have all my female plumbing removed , since my cancer is ERPR + . Sounds like your family history is full of this dreaded disease , too . I 'm sorry your family has had to go down this road . Has your sister regretted her decision to remove her breasts and female plumbing ? My twin is a bit unnerved by this whole thing ... to be expected . I think I 've gotten everyone ... if not ... know I 'm thinking about you and wishing you nothing but dreamfilled nights , energy filled days , and clear headed minds :--RRB- By the way , Charlie Wilson 's War , was FABULOUS !!!! It 's amazing what this man did ... and how we find ourselves in the same position again ... doing the same thing we 've always done only this time without a man like Charlie on the team . When will our gov ' t learn from its mistakes ? I read the Kite Runner , YuYuBear , and hear the movie is really good ... but I loved the book so much and do n't want to spoil what I imagined in my head ... and heard the movie gives too much away too soon . I 'll have to wait and see if I can bring myself to go see it . I 'm a little weird when it comes to my characters in what I read ... I literally have to grieve the end of a book ...

I choose the Breast Conservation . My surgery was Sept. 3rd .2009 m Ever thing went apparently well . I was happy to hear I had all negative nodes . I felt really good within a short time . I returned to my Doctor a week after surgery for my follow up and was very encouraged and my spirits we high . WELL , WHAT A WAMMY I RECEIVED !!!!! After careful dissection of the 3 nodes they in fact found another 3mm mass which was positive . So , I was rescheduled for another surgery Sept. 17th for a complete `` Axillary Dissection '' . This was so hard on me . I cried a lot . But , as difficult as it was I made it through . I 'm a good bit more tender because of the incision is right under the arm . Very sensitive area !!! And the drain surely is no joy . I am dealing with it well though . And , even though my Doctor said they would prescribe + suggest I would need 6 weeks off of work , I returned to work 3 days later . I did OK . I have an office job and I 'm pretty much alone , so dealing with the drain was not a problem either NOW , I RECIEVED MORE NEWS !!!!!!!! I had one more positive -LRB- 6mm -RRB- node . If I had n't had any bad nodes , I would had to only do radiation , but because of the new findings , even if was just the one positive node , this will mean of course I do need Chemo therapy also . I seen my hemotologist yesterday and he said more than likely I 'll have the chemo first -LRB- about 3 weeks from now -RRB- , I need to heal a bit more first . Then I 'll have the radiation and I will still of course be doing the blockers for the hormones . Ny hemotoligist is meeting with the Radiology along with my surgeon before the exact type of meds are prescribed to me . I will have some choices , and I know at this point because my cancer is so very invasive , I will want just as an aggressive therapy .

You and I and Terry are the only three I think at this point who are finished .

Getting it checked out is obviously the right thing ... but question ? Did you have a PET scan or Breast MRI ? If I did n't have those , my surgeon stated they never would have known about the other two tumors I had . My mammo caught only one ... and the ultrasound found it no problem ... but when I asked that the Dr. do my underarm the ultrasound scan did n't catch the tumor under my arm because it did n't know exactly where to locate it , since it did n't show up on my initial mammo . The PET showed the other two ... on at 7:30 and one in the axillary . The breast MRI confirmed the original tumor and the one at 7:30 , but could n't see the one under the arm because it could n't see under my arms the way they positioned me . The surgeon stated that without those two tests , I would have had a lumpectomy . She felt the underarm tumor as soon as she knew where to locate it , but she had to press in pretty far to feel it . So , just want to make sure you were clear that your surgeon can only go by what info they are given ... not that a second opinion is n't always a good option ... just wanted to give the surgeon the benefit of the doubt . Hope your daughter has a good game tonight . Carol - You rock ... I 'll check out the website , then PM my order .

0,True,"Wendy , I have walked down your road before and have a very strong opinion on your question . Zeloda is a magnificent medication and also very effective . Are you aware that it is 5 FU in pill form ? 5FU is a chemo . drug . Zeloda has been by far the least invasive of all the chemo drugs I have been on and I had very good results with it . I stayed on Zeloda for approx . 2.5 years and really beat the beast back . My T.M.s were way down and then the med . stopped working for me . Then of course we tried other hormaonals and when they did n't work , on my way to I.V. chemos . The Zeloda allowed me to maintain my normal lifestyle without weekly visits to the Onc . for I.V. meds . I continued to travel at will with my dose of oral medications . Now , I am not saying that there were no side effects , but they were relatively minimal . Sometimes the pills did n't sit well in my stomach and I had a good dose of hand foot syndrome but it was a trade off . I am now on I.V. meds . 3 wks . on 1 wk . off . The side effects can be numerous and if I want to travel I have to make arrangements with another physician . -LSB- Which is n't always easy -RSB- So , needless to say , I am a great cheerleader for Zeloda and wish that it were still effective for me .

I met a lady at the dog park who had her BC in 1985 and told me she often forgets which side it was on . When I told my bible study group about 25 women , 3 of them were survivors . One was 22 years out from a double mast , one was 17 years and one 11years out . All of them are still just fine . What you need to know is that the vast majority of us will recover and be just fine . When you are on the net and even on this site , it looks like nothing but bad news . But truly , all the women I started with are long past posting , living their lives , and BC is fading as just another bump in the road . I am so sorry to hear about your husband . So tragic . I am a life long panic attack/depressive/anxiety attack , and I know that the suffering is horrible , and if that was where he was , God bless his soul . Keep posting , we have wonderful women here who can help you with the whole journey . This is really not a lot different from getting the news you are diabetic or have heart disease , just for some reason it scares us all silly . You are not alone , you are a sister , you are welcomed and cherished on this board . We will do all we can to make this journey doable and sometimes even a little humor pops up . So if you need to , ask your doc for Ativan , or Xanax , and just take one when you wake up in the morning you are going for an appt . or a treatment . If you have severe problems , consider anti-depressives , they are truly a miracle . We truly care about you and your family . So feel at home and post any old time . Gentle hugs , Shirlann ",just another bump in the road . I am so sorry
4,False,"I had my port put on on Feb 25 , A week later we went on a vacation before the start of my chemo on March 24 . No one gave me any idea at all how much the port would hurt and riding in a car 8 hours to get where we were going was miserable . The bouncing over bumps etc in the road made the port bounce too , I was sore there for 2 days after each car ride and had to sleep with head elevated . And of course since we drove to get there we had to drive back too ! Since I will be having taxol for 12 weekly doses and then herceptin every 3 weeks for the balance of a year a port was the only option . The worst of the pain was gone at about 3 weeks but I still have to watch how I lay down at night . We will see how it goes with my first round on Tuesday .

2,True,"I had 2 mammograms , and one ultra sound that was clear and said I did n't have cancer . Then they ordered a needle biopsy of the lump under my arm , and the tissue came back with cancer cells . Because they ca n't find the tumor they ordered a Cat-Scan to check the chest , liver , stomach area , and a full body Bone-Scan , and found no cancer anywhere else in the body except the breast . The lump may be the tumor they said even though it is n't actually on the breast . I would think even though the cancer cells have not stuck anywhere and started a growth that they may be floating around getting ready to so the reason for the Chemo would be to kill any of those cells floating around . That is just my guess . They will also do on me radiation and targeted Herceptin treatment to the cancer cells in that lump , and finally a mastectomy . I have heard those bone biopsies are extremely painful so do n't think I would ask for one unless they seen it necessary . Absolute be your own health advocate in research to know what is going on with your body , but you have to rely on these OC that specializes in the cancer too . Hope this helps some . I know it is a difficult time . Just getting those test back yesterday seemed like a weight of tremendous magnitude was lifted off me . Yes bad news is I have a very aggressive kind of breast cancer , and good news is I have a very aggressive kind of breast cancer ... hey its in the breast and not spread anywhere else at this point so I am very happy just to know that .

2,True,"Lali , It seems like a good choice by your oncologists to offer you Xeloda , in light of the PET demonstrated intramammary node . Guess this node is too deep to safely biopsy , those intramammary nodes sometimes presenting in such critical places . Studies have shown that even small doses of radiation can cause an increase in the essential enzyme necessary for the activation of the Xeloda , and even better , enhance Xeloda 's effect . So your doctor 's are right on the button with their advise . Xeloda can cause problems with diarrhea and a condition called hand foot syndrome . Here is a brief link to some explaination of this : http://www.fda.gov/Cder/consumerinfo/druginfo/Xeloda.HTM There 's been some phase III trial 's demonstrating benefit of adding Lapatinib to Xeloda -LRB- capecitabine -RRB- in women with prior Anthracycline and Taxane exposure . Perhaps you may wish to ask your oncologist about this . Sounds like you have a good oncology/radiation oncology team working with you .

0,True,"Hi Deb . I had DCIS on right side and had a unilateral mastectomy Sept 2008 . The following July 2009 , I had a prophylactic mastectomy on the other side . I wish i had done them both at the same time . It is a very personal decision and you will get opinions on both sides . For me , I could n't stand the constant thought of going for testing down the road . I also saw my mom succomb to breast cancer 20 years ago even though I tested BRCA negative . It is not 100 percent guaranteed , but I know in my heart that I def made the decision best for me . I do miss the natural sensations of my breasts but I know that I could n't deal with the worry each time I had a mammo .

0,True,"Upon my DX and being advised I 'd need a mastectomy , I immediately wanted a bilat , but was told it was not necessary or possible . While going thru chemo , I watched a lot of daytime TV during Oct. , Cancer Awareness Month . Kept seeing women who had proudly gone thru 2 bouts of cancer . I thought : anything I can do to avoid a second recurrence , I would do it . Started researching recurrence rates : I had been monitored for cystic breasts for maybe 6 years previous to DX. , and we knew I had microcalcs , and my breast surgeon told me I 'd likely have trouble down the road , and sure enough , there I was . I had to fight tooth and nail to get t his done . I showed up at my surgeon with an inch thick stack of studies . He finally relented and agreed because of my mental state . Yeah , right , * I 'm * nuts . Whatever . I 'm almost 3 years out , and do n't regret it ONE BIT . It 's a huge relief . We 'll never know who was right and who was wrong , but * I 'm * the one who has to live with this . Going in for bilat DIEP mid . June . No regrets . I think we know in our hearts what 's right .

0,True,"Had a bilateral and did not have nipple sparing since they discovered the cancer had gone into my nodes . I am very much in the mode of do what ever needs to be done to help prevent reoccurance Have to admit having had a chance to discuss it with my ps since we were going to try and save them until they discovered it in the nodes and my ps , bs , and myself decided if it had gone further not to do the sparing . Very new to this since I was diagnosed on 10/25 and had surgery on 11/03 so if anyone can give me some insight from experience what goes into reconstructing the nipples I would really appriciate it .

6,True,"I am in the same boat , 4mm Her2 + . I am ER - and PR slightly positive . 1st opinion at local hospital said it is not the national standard to treat with chemo and herceptin but if I wanted them to , they would . 2nd opinion at bigger hospital said he does n't care about the size of the tumor , he wants to treat the biology of it , recommended chemo and herceptin . 3rd opinion at a larger cancer institute said no chemo and herceptin because there are not enough studies to support the benefits on a tumor so small . Came down to I did not want to regret not being as aggressive as possible . This might be my only chance to have it cured . It is a very hard decision . I am waiting for the second of 6 rounds TCH .

2,True,"Hi everyone - I was diagnosed with high grade DCIS back in November and have since had a partial masectomy and reduction . My biopsy came back with no invasive cancer , thankfully , but I did have one margin that was not clean . I just had my re-excision which was pretty extensive but they did get it all . Now I am about to start radiation and I am wondering if anyone has had any surgery post radiation . After my re-excision , it left that breast looking somewhat disfigured and I am thinking that I might want to make that look a little better but I am hearing that healing after radiation can be very difficult . I know this might seem like a superficial question in light of what many of you are going through , but as we all know this is a very emotionally complicated thing to experience and live through and right now it is hard not to look at my breast and just think about the cancer . Any input would be appreciated ",like a superficial question in light of what many of you
