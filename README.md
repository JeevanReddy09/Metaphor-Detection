This study utilizes a PyTorch-based neural network,
named MetaphorNN, to detect metaphors
in text through a machine learning approach.
The methodology encompasses data preparation,
context extraction, and TF-IDF feature
engineering. MetaphorNN employs fully connected
layers with ReLU activations for binary
classification. The training process involves
dataset splitting and iterative training using
stochastic gradient descent. Evaluation metrics
provide insights into the modelâ€™s effectiveness,
contributing valuable findings to the natural
language processing field for applications like
sentiment analysis and creative writing support.
